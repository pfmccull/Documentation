This file scrapes the team pages of baseball reference, extracts the player appearances table, and saves the resulting pandas data frame as a csv file.

Functions findTables() and pullTable() are from Ben Kite's Baseball Reference Scraping files. Located here: https://github.com/BenKite/baseball_data/blob/master/baseballReferenceScrape.py
